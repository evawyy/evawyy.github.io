# Play Music Games Together 
Today we have played music games together all the afternoon. Even though we all felt exhausted at the end, we were happy. 
My life is so colorful and cozy. Right? With all the love from parents and friends, I have nothing to worry about. I appreciate 
all the goodness happening ... I hope all the critical persons and stuffs would never leave me away. Anyway, E dancing can benefit 
my health a lot. I can work out and not get bored.
