# Play Music Games Together 
Today, we spent the entire afternoon playing music games together. Although we were all exhausted by the end, we were happy. My life feels so colorful and cozy, doesn't it? With the love and support from my parents and friends, I have nothing to worry about. I'm truly grateful for all the good things happening in my life. I hope the important people and things never leave me. Anyway, E's dancing really benefits my healthâ€”I can work out without ever getting bored.
