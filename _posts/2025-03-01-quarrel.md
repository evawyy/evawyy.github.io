#We have a quarrel: 
He is complaining me about my lost in others stories all the day. I sink into some ridiculous experience from nowhere and 
do nothing at all. Byl is so angry at me. Ok, fine it's my fault. 
I feel so guilty and regretful for what I have done. But I am too humidly to admit my badness and refuse to say sorry. Ahhh, 
people shouldn't be so bad after all.
I swear I won't waste my time anymore. Ok, that's all. (Actually, I don't know what I'm talking about, he made me to record, so I did.)
