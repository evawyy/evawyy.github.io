#We have a quarrel: 
We had a quarrel. He keeps complaining to me about my getting lost in other people’s stories all day. I drift into ridiculous experiences out of nowhere and do nothing at all. Byl is so angry with me. Fine, it’s my fault. I feel so guilty for what I have done. But I am too ashamed to admit my mistakes and refuse to say sorry. Ahhh, people shouldn’t be like this after all. I swear I won’t waste any more time. Alright, that’s all. (Actually, I don’t know what I’m talking about. He made me record, so I did.)
