Today we went to the concert of Cyndi Wang, who is a very famous singer in China. Mr. Drichy and I both had a good time. I was so excited about the live show and had the chance to see her in person. She is so gorgeous and pretty. Her songs are so beautiful and sweet. This is our first time seeing a live show. It was an impressive experience. I hope we can have another chance to go to a live show.
